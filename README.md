## Introduction to React 
<p>React is an open-source JavaScript framework and library. It's uses Webpack to compile React, JSX, and ES6, auto-prefix CSS files.</p>

### JSX

Background: When Facebook created React, the main concept introduced into React was that we had to write a lot of HTML in JavaScript because JS was very performant.

- JSX is not "HTML inside JavaScript", but it has "HTML-like" syntax
- Browser cannot understand JSX, so need **Babel** to convert it.
- Advantages:
    - Developer experience
    - Readability
    - Less code
    - Maintainability
    - No repetition

### DOM
#### Traditional Way of Development

<p>Everytime when any of the element update, will re-render the entire DOM again, this causes a lot of unnecessary workload! E.g. If there is a name variable changed from Peter to John in a child element of < Body > then entire HTML should re-render again.</p>

#### React Virtual DOM

<p>We need Virtual DOM for <b>Reconcilation</b>. Reconcilation is an algorithum that React used to different one component tree from others. It do compare and determine what needs to change and what does not in UI. <b>To find out DIFFERENT between one <i>tree</i> (ACTUAL DOM) and other (VIRTUAL DOM)</b>.</p>

### Component
  
- Smallest Unit of Interface
- Everything is a component in React
- Two types:
    - Functional component - NEW
    - Class-based component - OLD

<p>Every part of the webpage can spread into small components, and all the component is reuseable.</p>

### Controlled component and Uncontrolled Component
#### Controlled Component
<p>Controlled Components are those in which forms' data is handled by the componentâ€™s state. It takes its current value through props and makes changes through callbacks like onClick, onChange, etc. A parent component manages its own state and passes the new value as props to the controlled component.</p>

#### Uncontrolled Component
<p>Uncontrolled Components are the components that are not controlled by the React state and are handled by the DOM. So in order to access any value that has been entered we take help of refs
</p>

### What is Babel?

<p>To know Babel, we have to know what is <b>Pollyfill</b>. To make older browers understand our new code, the new code is converted into a older code, which browser can understand called Pollyfill. Babel do this conversion automatically.</p>

<p>E.g. - ES6 is the newer version of JavaScript, if I'm working on 1999's browser, my browser will not understand what is `const`, `new Promise`, etc. So, there is a replacement code for these functionalities which is compatible with older version of browsers.</p>

<p>Babel is a combination of compiler and also transpiles. Therefore it is known as Transpiler. Babel is a library for transpiling different js or ts code into browser compatible code.
</p>

### How React Work

# Hooks
![image](https://github.com/AlanTeeWeiLoon/React-Course-Content/assets/104622787/d79a1aee-091b-4c17-8c36-b8be47b8ace7)

## UseState

![image](https://github.com/AlanTeeWeiLoon/React-Course-Content/assets/104622787/aa675ca7-ca36-46fd-986e-3a7e0e7e495d)


<p>In React, that is a new way to create variable. If we need to create local variables in React, then need to use state variables. State variables are created using <b>useState</b> hook. </p>

## UseEffect

![image](https://github.com/AlanTeeWeiLoon/React-Course-Content/assets/104622787/658586d6-828f-4955-94f7-0d74afeb3678)

<p>useEffect is a function. We call this function by passing another function to it which is a callback function.</p>

![image](https://github.com/AlanTeeWeiLoon/React-Course-Content/assets/104622787/d26ee541-d9bf-4890-b06b-3a3b39e47f6f)

`useEffect(callback function, dependency array)`

<p>Callback function means the function is not called immediately but called whenever useEffect wanted it to be called.</p>

<p>useEffect will be called on every re-render, this is a bad way. So id dont want to call it after every re-render, we have to pass in a dependency array.</p>

## UseRef

## UseContext

useContext hook is designed to solve **Props Drilling** issue. Props drilling is when a parent component passes data down to its children and then those children pass the same data down to their own children. And maybe some of the children is no need the props, then this will cause many unnessary workload.

useContext is the best solution to solve props drilling issue in **small size project**. For large project that consist of large number of data, may use redux to manage.

## UseReducer

useReducer helps to manage complex state logic in React applications.

`const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init?)`

## UseParams
Provide by react-router-dom library, it's the routing parameters

Example: 
URL path: "/user/:id" , so we can

`import {useParams} from 'react-router-dom';`

`const params = useParams();`

`const {id} = params;`

to get the id.

## UseCallback

useCallback is to prevent a component from re-rendering unless its props have changed.

`const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)`

# AXIOS
Axios in React is a library that serves to create promised-based HTTP requests. It has the ability to make HTTP requests from the browser and handle the transformation of request and response data. It support Create, Read, Update and Delete **(CRUD)** methods.

Sample:

```
const getData = () => {
    axios
      .get("http://localhost:4000/comments")
      .then((response) => setComment(response.data))
      .catch((error) => console.log(error))
  }
```

# REDUX - State Mangement Library
#### Why need Redux? (As previously mentioned able to solve props drilling issue)

# Router

### Problem with anchor tag < a >

`<a>` will relead the entire page when it is clicked. It disrupts user experience and can result in a slower page load time. This cause problems for **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**.

### Single Page Applications (SPAs)

<p>React apps are SPAs. Having SPAs will not reload, it will not make network call when we are changing pages. It loads a single HTML page and dynamically update the page in response to users without reloading the entire page. </p>

### Type of Routing
- Server-side routing
    - pages come from servers
    - will make network call, get the HTML, JS, CSS and loads the whole page
- Client-side routing
    - dynamically update content of SPA in response to change in URL
    - don't do full page reload

In React, we can use react-router-dom library's `<Link>` tag instaed of  `<a>` tag
